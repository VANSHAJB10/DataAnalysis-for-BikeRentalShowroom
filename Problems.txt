1. James would like to know how many bikes the shop owns by category. 
Display the category name and the number of bikes the shop owns in each category (call this column number_of_bikes). 
Show only the categories where the number of bikes is greater than 2.


2. James needs a list of customer names with the total number of memberships purchased by each.

For each customer, display the customer's name and the count of memberships purchased (call this column membership_count). 
Sort the results by membership_count, starting with the customer who has purchased the highest number of memberships.
Keep in mind that some customers may not have purchased any memberships yet. In such a situation, display 0 for the membership_count.


3. James is working on a special offer for the winter months. Prepare a list of new rental prices.

For each bike, display its ID, category, old price per hour (call this column old_price_per_hour), discounted price per hour (call it new_price_per_hour), old price per day (call it old_price_per_day), and discounted price per day (call it new_price_per_day).
Electric bikes should have a 10% discount for hourly rentals and a 20% discount for daily rentals. Mountain bikes should have a 20% discount for hourly rentals and a 50% discount for daily rentals. All other bikes should have a 50% discount for all types of rentals.
Round the new prices to 2 decimal digits.


4. James is looking for counts of the rented bikes and of the available bikes in each category.

Display the number of available bikes (call this column available_bikes_count) and the number of rented bikes (call this column rented_bikes_count) by bike category.


5. James is preparing a sales report. He needs to know the total revenue from rentals by month, the total by year, and the all-time across all the years.

Display the total revenue from rentals for each month, the total for each year, and the total across all the years. Do not take memberships into account. There should be 3 columns: year, month, and revenue.
Sort the results chronologically. Display the year total after all the month totals for the corresponding year. Show the all-time total as the last row.


6. James has asked you to get the total revenue from memberships for each combination of year, month, and membership type.

Display the year, the month, the name of the membership type (call this column membership_type_name), and the total revenue (call this column total_revenue) for every combination of year, month, and membership type.
Sort the results by year, month, and name of membership type.


7. Next, James would like data about memberships purchased in 2023, with subtotals and grand totals for all the different combinations of membership types and months.

Display the total revenue from memberships purchased in 2023 for each combination of month and membership type. Generate subtotals and grand totals for all possible combinations. There should be 3 columns: membership_type_name, month, and total_revenue.
Sort the results by membership type name alphabetically and then chronologically by month.


8. James wants to segment customers based on the number of rentals and see the count of customers in each segment.

Categorize customers based on their rental history as follows:

Customers who have had more than 10 rentals are categorized as 'more than 10'.
Customers who have had 5 to 10 rentals (inclusive) are categorized as 'between 5 and 10'.
Customers who have had fewer than 5 rentals should be categorized as 'fewer than 5'.
Calculate the number of customers in each category. Display two columns: rental_count_category (the rental count category) and customer_count (the number of customers in each category).
